## Revenue

For this service, the easiest option would be a monthly fee (subscription service) that gives user access to the data. The value provided for now comes only from the aggregated and filtered data. If needed, later on payed courses could be added to the portfolio.

## Costs

### Domain

### Servers

### Data Verification
